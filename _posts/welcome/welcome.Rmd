Hello reader!

Blogging is very different for me. I tend to be quite a private person. While I really enjoy developing ideas and collaboratiev learning among a group of peers or colleagues (there is something magical about the cohesion of learning together), the idea of publishing my thoughts much more publicly is completely new to me and, frankly, daunting. This will be a challenge but I'm looking forward to trying this out! 

Please feel free to reach out or comment if you have any questions or suggestions! I am always looking for feedback and am eager to hear what others have learned along the way. 

I can be contacted at lhage@gradcenter.cuny.edu

Cheers!

Lyndsay
